# Qwiiver Synthesizer
## Music 171 Final Project.

This represents a program that allows one to use a Wiimote to control and shape sounds from an 11 member voice bank. The voices used can be customized by editing the file [VoicesLib.txt](VoicesLib.txt). It frees ones hands from the necessity of editing values, and allows one to sit back and simply create sounds and mixes by listening to the output.

To run the patch, open the file [QwiiverSynth.pd](Qwiiversynth.pd).
Instructions on how to use the patch are there.

This project was built with Pd-Vanilla. While it should still run in Pd-Extended, some behaviour may not function correctly.
